  <p>The intent of this website is to show how Fort Atkinson Wisconsin has changed over time.</p>

  <h2>Main Map</h2>

  <p>In the upper right you can choose what kind of background map will display, 
    and the layers that you can toggle in the lower right are historical maps and images of the town.  
    These include fire insurance maps, surveys, and aerial photos from 1937.</p>

  <h2>Fort Atkinson Over Time</h2>

  <p>This map shows how Fort Atkinson has grown since its founding. The lines show the borders of the town at given years.
    The graphics show how the area of the town and the population of the town have changed.</p>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>

  <p>The fire insurance maps are from the Sanborn company, who produced very detailed maps of most towns in America from the late 1800's into the mid 1900's.
    They include information relevant to insurance such as building materials, contents of the buildings, staffing, and business activities.
    The examples used in this web page were sourced from the Library of Congress, 
    and you can search for more examples in their collection <a href= "https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/about-this-collection/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>The aerial images are from a set taken between 1937 and 1941 by the Department of Agriculture, and all of the photos in this map are from 1937. 
    The full set for Wisconsin can be explored at the <a href= "https://maps.sco.wisc.edu/WHAIFinder/">Wisconsin Historic Aerial Image Finder</a>, 
    from the State Cartographer's Office.</p> 
  <p>The first survey of the town is from a blueprint of the original, courtesy of the Hoard Museum.</p>
  <p>The physical growth of the town was derived from maps and descriptions of the town at various points in time, and the borders generally represent residential areas.  
    The population data is from the U.S. Census.</p>

  <p>I owe a special thanks to the Hoard Museum and the staff for providing access to the Knox Archives and giving me guidance on Fort Atkinson's history when I 
    didn't know where to look. I couldn't have followed my interest in local history as far as I have without them, and this would not be possible without their help.
