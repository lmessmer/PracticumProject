  <p>The intent of this website is to show how Fort Atkinson Wisconsin has changed over time.</p>

  <h2>Main Map</h2>

  <p>In the upper right you can choose what kind of background map will display, 
    and the layers that you can toggle in the lower right are historical maps and images of the town.  
    These include fire insurance maps, surveys, and aerial photos from 1937.</p>

  <h2>Growth Over Time</h2>

  <p>This map shows how Fort Atkinson has grown since its founding. The lines, which can be toggled in the lower right, show the borders of the town at given years.
    The graphic shows how the area of the town and the population of the town have changed</p>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>

  <p>The fire insurance maps are from the Sanborn company, who produced very detailed maps of most towns in America from the late 1800's into the mid 1900's.
    The examples used in this web page were sourced from the Library of Congress, 
    and you can search for more examples in their collection <a href= "https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/about-this-collection/">here</a>.</p>
